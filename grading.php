			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>My project consists of 10 + 2 (grading and references) pages</li>
				<li>I have filled the criteria for the pages and wrote my own text</li>
				<li>Regarding the code, i wrote it as I would on an exam mostly from memory - but if i
					needed reference for syntax, I would make sure to understand it before
					implementing it in my code.</li>
				<li>I have added prefixes for css to include older browser support.</li>

				<li>Every file validates except the css file which fails to validate only because of
					prefixes which the validator finds as errors.</li>
				<li>One thing I could improve on is navigations, but i really couldn't get javascript
					working to change the background from transparend (on hero photos) to filled so
					I just left it as is because it looks good (I know it's not the best
					functinality but don't judge me).</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Design</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I really focused hard on design and got my OCD working</li>
				<li>I think it looks ok, just needs a bit of polishing </li>
				<li>Another thing I am worried about is consisteny, since I changed my ideas for the
					design a million times - but in the end tried to keep it more or less the same
					(except the home page).</li>
				<li>I implemented the highlighted navbar links for the current page (also couldn't get
					it working for the children pages of activities.html no matter what I tried)
				</li>
				<li>I have an interactive map which I embedded (gmaps) without causing errors in html,
					yay!.</li>
				<li>I like arrows and used them to enhance the flow of the page. Also those tabs with
					pictures popping up were inspired by the call of duty menu styles.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Media</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I made a big effort to get the right media for the page so it looks modern and up to
					date (no wonky low quality images)</li>
				<li>For the video clips, I edited 2 of them with clips i found online (bike and other),
					but the skiing video is my own. </li>

				<li>It's so late the sun started to come out, this is finally over! All in all I
					concluded that I will be starting the next project sooner, as I like making
					them, but trying to debug 1700 lines of css just to find out I missed one letter
					in the name is too much stress for 1 day. I somehow did this and I am proud I
					didn't quit. I don't even know what I'm writing anymore.</li>
